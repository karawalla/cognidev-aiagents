# AI Agents System Specification

## System Overview
An enterprise-grade AI agent orchestration system that enables seamless integration with internal services and enterprise tools. The system follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture similar to n8n, allowing for flexible workflow creation and management.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Core
- **Agent Runtime Environment**
  - Docker-based isolated execution environment
  - Resource management and scaling
  - State management and persistence
  - Error handling and recovery

- **Agent Protocol**
  - Standardized communication interface
  - Event-driven message bus
  - State synchronization
  - Error propagation

### 2. Integration Framework

#### Connection Management
- Secure credential storage
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breaking
- Retry mechanisms

#### Supported Integration Types
- REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- GraphQL endpoints
- WebSocket connections
- Database connectors
- Message queues
- Event streams

#### Enterprise Tool Connectors
- Version Control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- CI/CD (Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions)
- CRM (Salesforce, Dynamics)
- Project Management (Jira, Azure DevOps)
- Communication (Slack, MS Teams)
- Custom internal services

### 3. Pipeline Engine

#### Workflow Components
- Source nodes (data input)
- Transform nodes (data processing)
- Action nodes (task execution)
- Decision nodes (flow control)
- Sink nodes (data output)

#### Pipeline Features
- Visual workflow builder
- Real-time pipeline monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Conditional branching
- Parallel execution
- Data transformation
- State persistence

### 4. Security Framework

#### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 / OIDC integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management
- Service account support

#### Data Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Data masking
- Audit logging
- Compliance controls

## Technical Architecture

### Infrastructure
- Docker-based deployment
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Service mesh integration
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection

### Data Flow
1. Source connector ingests data
2. Pipeline processes data through nodes
3. Transform nodes modify/enrich data
4. Action nodes execute business logic
5. Sink nodes output results

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of agents
- Load balancing
- Distributed execution
- Caching layer
- Message queue integration

## API Specifications

### Agent API
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /agents:
    post: # Create agent
    get:  # List agents
  /agents/{id}:
    get:    # Get agent
    put:    # Update agent
    delete: # Delete agent
  /agents/{id}/execute:
    post:   # Execute agent
```

### Pipeline API
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
